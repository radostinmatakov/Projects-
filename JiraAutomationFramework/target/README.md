Before running the tests please make sure that:

1 - You have to enter your own credentials for trello.

2 - You should not have any created boards in your trello, tests are made for creating First Board. Please allow your first board to be created through the first test.

3 - Run the tests one by one starting from top.

4 - If Drag and Drop does not drop for some reason(sometimes it does not drop I still couldn't find the reason) deletion test will fail.
